AB  - Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality. 
      BAV aortic dilatation is associated with an increased risk of adverse aortic 
      events and represents a potentially lethal disease and hence a considerable 
      medical burden. BAV with aortic dilatation warrants frequent monitoring, and 
      elective surgical intervention is the only effective method to prevent dissection 
      or rupture. The predictive value of the aortic diameter is known to be limited. 
      The aortic diameter is presently still the main reference standard for surgical 
      intervention owing to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of BAV aortopathy 
      progression. This article provides a brief comprehensive review of the current 
      knowledge on BAV aortopathy regarding clinical definitions, epidemiology, natural 
      course, and pathophysiology, as well as hemodynamic and clinically significant 
      aspects on the basis of the limited data available.
