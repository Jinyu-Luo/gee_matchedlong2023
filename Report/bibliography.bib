The estimating equations are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a subject's observations yet they reduce to the score equations for niultivariate Gaussian outcomes. Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the pioposecl estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.}",

abstract = {Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality. BAV aortic dilatation is associated with an increased risk of adverse aortic events and represents a potentially lethal disease and hence a considerable medical burden. BAV with aortic dilatation warrants frequent monitoring, and elective surgical intervention is the only effective method to prevent dissection or rupture. The predictive value of the aortic diameter is known to be limited. The aortic diameter is presently still the main reference standard for surgical intervention owing to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of BAV aortopathy progression. This article provides a brief comprehensive review of the current knowledge on BAV aortopathy regarding clinical definitions, epidemiology, natural course, and pathophysiology, as well as hemodynamic and clinically significant aspects on the basis of the limited data available.},

abstract = {Background— Replacement of the ascending aorta (Asc Ao) at the time of aortic valve replacement (AVR) is controversial because the risk of progressive dilatation following valve replacement is uncertain. Our aim was to determine the natural history of ascending aortic dilatation following AVR. Methods and Results— We studied 185 patients undergoing AVR at our institution between 1992 and 1999. Clinical and echocardiographic data were obtained by merging our institutional echocardiographic database with the DHMC component of the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group database. Baseline Asc Ao measurements obtained from intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms or early (\&lt;8 weeks) postoperative transthoracic echocardiograms were compared with late follow-up measurements (mean follow-up 30.0±23.4 months). During follow-up, there was no increase in the mean Asc Ao diameter (3.6±0.6 cm versus 3.6±0.6 cm, p=NS). Progressive aortic dilatation, defined as an increase in diameter \&gt;0.3 cm, occurred in 27/185 patients (15\%). Baseline Asc Ao dilatation (≥3.5 cm) was present in 107/185 patients (58\%). In this subset of patients, there was no increase in mean Asc Ao diameter (4.0±0.4 versus 3.9±0.6 cm, p=NS) and progressive aortic dilatation occurred in only 10 patients (9.3\%). No patients with baseline aortic dilatation (range, 3.5 to 5.3 cm) dilated beyond 5.5 cm on follow-up (range, 2.4 to 5.5 cm). There were no clinical or valvular characteristics that predicted progressive Asc Ao dilatation. Conclusions— An increase in Asc Ao dilatation occurs infrequently following AVR and therefore, argues against routine Asc Ao replacement at the time of AVR.}}

abstract = {We compared the long-term outcomes and difference in dilatation rates of the ascending aorta after aortic valve (AV) replacement (AVR) between bicuspid and tricuspid AV patients, and evaluated risk factors associated with ascending aorta dilatation and aortic events during the follow-up. Of 1,127 patients who underwent AVR from 1995 to 2015, 259 patients with a dilated ascending aorta (≥40 mm in diameter) were included. The patients were divided into those with bicuspid (group bicuspid aortic valve [BAV], n = 105) and with tricuspid (group tricuspid aortic valve [TAV], n = 154) AV, and a propensity score-matched analysis was performed to match 98 patients in each group. The differences in the dilation rate of the ascending aorta and long-term outcomes were analyzed. Risk factors for ascending aorta dilatation, mortality, and aortic events were identified. Follow-up was completed in 100% of patients with a median follow-up duration of 106.1 [68.8, 163.0] months. The early clinical outcomes and dilation rate of the ascending aorta were similar between the groups. Overall survivals up to 15 years postoperatively were similar between groups BAV and TAV (p = 0.223). Aortic events occurred in 6 patients (groups BAV vs TAV, 2 vs 4;p = 0.678). Preoperative ascending aorta diameter showed a linear relationship with the dilatation rate of ascending aorta (p <0.001) and was related to progressive aortic dilatation and aortic events (odds ratio: 1.25, p <0.001 and hazard ratio = 1.56, p <0.001, respectively). In conclusion, the long-term outcomes and ascending aorta dilatation rate were similar between the BAV and TAV patients up to 15 years after AVR. Bicuspid AV was not a risk factor of mortality or aortic events.}

abstract = {Accurate measurement of abdominal aortic aneurysms is necessary to predict rupture risk and, more recently, to follow aneurysm sac behavior following endovascular repair. Up until this point, aneurysm diameter has been the most common measurement utilized for these purposes. Although aneurysm diameter is predictive of rupture, accurate measurement is hindered by such factors as aortic tortuosity and interobserver variability, and it does not account for variations in morphology such as saccular aneurysms. Additionally, decreases in aneurysm diameter do not completely describe the somewhat complex remodeling seen following endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. Measurement of aneurysm volume has the advantage of describing aneurysm morphology in a multidimensional fashion, but it has not been readily available or easily measured until recently. This has changed with the introduction of commercially available software tools that permit quicker and easier to perform volume measurements. Whether it is time for volume to replace, or compliment, diameter is the subject of the current debate.}

On the basis of sampling experiments which compare the performance of quasi t-statistics, we find that one estimator, based on the jackknife, performs better in small samples than the rest. We also examine the finite-sample properties of using modified critical values based on Edgeworth approximations, as proposed by Rothenberg (1984). In addition, we compare the power of several tests for heteroskedasticity, and find that it may be wise to employ the jackknife heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix even in the absence of detected heteroskedasticity.}

Recently, Crowder (Biometrika 82 (1995) 407–410) has pointed out some pitfalls with the estimation of the correlation parameters in the GEE method. In this paper we present a new method for estimating the correlation parameters which overcomes those pitfalls. For some commonly assumed correlation structures, we obtain unique feasible estimates for the correlation parameters. Large sample properties of our estimates are also established.}

Inference 63, 39–54) introduced the method of quasi-least squares (QLS) for estimating the regression, correlation and scale parameters in longitudinal data analysis problems. The QLS estimates of the regression and scale parameters are consistent even if the working correlation structure is misspecified. The estimate of the correlation parameter, however, is asymptotically biased. In this paper, we present modified (C-QLS) estimates of the correlation parameter for the following working correlation structures that are appropriate for the analysis of balanced and equally spaced longitudinal data: the unstructured matrix, for which the C-QLS estimate is a positive definite, consistent correlation matrix; and the exchangeable, tridiagonal, and autoregressive structures, for which the C-QLS estimates are feasible, consistent and robust against misspecification. We also present feasible and consistent C-QLS estimates for two structures appropriate for the analysis of unbalanced and unequally spaced longitudinal data: the Markov and generalized Markov working correlation structures that were discussed by Núñez-Anton and Woodworth (1994, Biometrics 50, 445– 456) and Shults and Chaganty (1998, Biometrics 54, 1622–1630). We then present an improved consistent estimate of the scale parameter. Finally, examples are given to contrast the C-QLS estimates with estimates obtained using the widely used generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach.}
