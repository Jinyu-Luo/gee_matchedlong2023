## Nov 14-18, 2022
### Meeting on Nov 15th
* GitHub setup, cloned repository
* Discussed about project background and details
* Discussed next steps
  + prepare for the presentation
  + review *Applied Longitudinal Analysis* (Chapter 11-13)
* Q&A:
  + What's the difference between GEE and GLMM?
    - The interpretation of the parameters is different. The target of inference of GEE is population-average, whereas the GLMM is subject-specific.
    
### Accomplishment
1. Literature Review
a) Propensity Score methods
b) Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)
c) Time-dependent Covariates (12.1-12.3)
d) Cardiovascular research
  * Improved Outcomes Following the Ross Procedure Compared With Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Replacement
e) review Generalized linear model
  
2. Presentation slides (draft)

3. On-boarding process
* completed the UHN Office of Research Trainee(ORT) e-registration form
* returned a signed offer of appointment, Personal Data and Emergency Contact Form and documents from the part A of appendix A(passport & study permit)
* Start date: December 5, 2022
* Orientation: Tuesday, December 13, 2022

### Questions
1.Why GEE with independent working correlation is used for unbiased estimation when the follow-up data is *truncated by death*?
2.What is the purpose of simulations before using the real data for this study?
3. How  do we include two correlation matrices for the matched pairs and the longitudinal responses while performing GEE?
4. What is the robust sandwich estimator? 
-> solved: section 13.2 from Applied Longitudinal Analysis, 
$Cov(\hat{\beta}) = B^{-1}MB^{-1}$
-> can obtain valid standard error for $\hat{\beta}$ under the misspecified model for the within-subject association, with large sample sizes
